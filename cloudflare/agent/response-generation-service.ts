### User Query
"${userQuery}"

### Execution Plan
${JSON.stringify(plan, null, 2)}

### API Results
${JSON.stringify(executionResults, null, 2)}

### Important Instructions
1.  **Directly answer the user's question.** Do not apologize or say you couldn't find information.
2.  **Use the data from the API results to form your answer.** Extract specific details like movie titles, ratings, release dates, and cast members.
3.  **If the API returns empty results, state that no results were found for the specific query.** Do not invent information. For example, if no Marvel movies are found after 2010, say so directly.
4.  **Present data clearly.** Use lists, bullet points, or tables for readability.
5.  **Be conversational and engaging, but get straight to the point.**

### Example Good Response (with data)
"Based on the data, here are the top-rated science fiction movies from 2023:
*   **Dune: Part Two:** Rated 8.4/10, starring Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya.
*   **Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse:** Rated 8.6/10, starring Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld."

### Example Good Response (no data)
"I couldn't find any science fiction movies released in 2023 in the database."

Now, provide a comprehensive and engaging response based on the API results above.
